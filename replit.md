## Development Setup

### Running Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Starts development server on port 5000
- Backend API available at `/api/*` endpoints
- Frontend served by Vite with HMR enabled

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
- Builds frontend assets to `dist/public/`
- Compiles backend server to `dist/index.js`

### Deployment
- Configured for Replit autoscale deployment
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Start command: `npm run start`

## Configuration Notes
- Server configured to listen on 0.0.0.0:5000 for Replit compatibility
- Vite configured with `allowedHosts: true` for proxy support
- Development and production modes properly separated
- All necessary Replit plugins configured for optimal development experience
